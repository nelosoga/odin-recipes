Hi! I’m Nelo! an inspiring software & web developer and this is one of my very first projects: Odin Recipes. It’s a simple website that compiles some of my favorite recipes, built as part of The Odin Project’s curriculum. The main goal of this project was to practice basic HTML structure and get comfortable working with links, lists, and images.

The site includes:
	•	A homepage with links to individual recipe pages
	•	Each recipe page features a list of ingredients, step-by-step instructions, and a photo of the dish
	•	Clean and readable HTML code following best practices for beginners

This project helped me understand how websites are structured and how to organize content in a meaningful way. I’m excited to keep improving it and start adding styles and interactivity as I learn more!
